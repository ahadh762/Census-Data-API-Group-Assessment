## Project Goals:
Our goal for this project is to ask preliminary questions, consume the APIs/explore the data, create diagrams from the API data, and answer the preliminary questions and provide our analysis of what the Census data represents.<br/><br/>
Each member of our team was assigned a survey to work analyze in our respective Jupyter Notebooks:
